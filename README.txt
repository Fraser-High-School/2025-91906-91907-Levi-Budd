here are explanations for what the settings do

mode:
Sets the quiz mode. Use 'quiz' to run questions and answers from questions.py, or 'math' to generate random math problems based on the difficulty and amount settings.

amount:
Sets how many questions or math problems will be generated. Only whole numbers (integers) are allowed.

difficulty:
Determines how complex the math problems are. For example, a difficulty of 2 generates problems like 16 + 7 or 20 / 5. A difficulty of 3 generates longer problems like 12 + 34 * 2 or 9 - 5 + 1. Only whole numbers are allowed.

password:
The password required to access the settings menu. Enter this before pressing "start quiz". Any string can be used.

name:
If set to True, the program will prompt for the quiz taker's name. If set to False, it will not ask for a name.

save:
If set to True, the results will be saved to results.txt. If set to False, results will not be saved.

results:
If set to True, the program will show results inside the application. If set to False, results will not be shown in the program.

color:
Sets the background color. You can use any color accepted by Tkinter, including standard color names (like grey) or hex codes (like #000000 for black).
